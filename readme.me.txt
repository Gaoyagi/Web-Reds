- motivation:  this project was motivated by a game I like to play with friends, easy to play with other and introduce others to this game

- structure: a website that relies primarily on buttons. 
	- Has total of 8 routes: home page, rules, game starting, drawing a card, discarding a card, exchanging cards, general game screen, and finishing the game. 
	- Has 6 HTML pages excluding the base.html: home screen, pre game screen, general game screen, drawing/drawn card screen, a finished screen, and a rules screen

- design: no time to implement CSS, all the cards are hard coded to their position in the upper left corner of the screen

- Notes: in the love version of the website, there is an internal server error bug that appears somewhat randomly. If you press the back button and then press another option it should disappear, if it doesn't do it again til it disappears
